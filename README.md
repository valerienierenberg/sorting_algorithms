# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Project Description:

This project introduces sorting algorithms and Big O notation. All functions are written in C.
Mandatory algorithms to learn:
* Bubble sort
* Insertion sort
* Selection sort
* Quick sort (with Lomuto partition scheme)

## Learning Objectives:
* At least four different sorting algorithms (4 mandatory and 9 advanced tasks)
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm
